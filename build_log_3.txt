./app/dashboard/leaderboard/page.tsx
66:8  Warning: React Hook useEffect has an unnecessary dependency: 'allRegions'. Either exclude it or remove the dependency array. Outer scope values like 'allRegions' aren't valid dependencies because mutating them doesn't re-render the component.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
